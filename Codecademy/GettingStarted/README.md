# Getting Started

## Why C++?
C++ and OOP and more features to C.

## Style Guide
Aka conventions
Codecademy follows Googleâ€™s C++ Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#cpplint)

### Include Statements
Gives us access to functionality from header file libraries. Include statements go a the beginning of files.

Include headers should be listed in this order
1. C system headers (like stdlib.h)
2. C++ standard library headers (like iostream)
3. User defined library headers

### Naming Conventions
- Avoid keywords (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword)
- Don't start with digit

For classes & functions, use PascalCase (aka UppercaseCamelCase)

For variables, names are all lowercase_with_underscores_between_words

### Punctuation Marks

Brackets `{}` Opening bracket goes on the same line as the statement. Closing bracket gets its own line.

Parens `()` just be neat, okay? they do specify some weird uses...

Commas `,` a space after each comma

### Formatting

#### Spacing
Just one line separating vertically. Normal horizontal spacing.

#### Indentation
Always two spaces at a time. NO TABS.

#### Line Length
Be reasonable. 80 chars.
